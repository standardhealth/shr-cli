# SHR Command-Line Interface

The Standard Health Record (SHR) initiative is working to create a single, high-quality health record for every individual in the United States.  For more information, see [standardhealthrecord.org](http://standardhealthrecord.org/).

This GitHub repository contains a Node.js command-line interface for parsing SHR text definitions and exporting them as FHIR profiles, [CIMCORE](https://github.com/standardhealth/shr-cli/wiki/CIMCORE-Documentation) JSON serialized files, JSON schema, ES6 classes, or a JSON document (for website generation).  Future versions of the CLI may support additional capabilities.

The SHR text definitions and grammar files can be found in the [shr_spec](https://github.com/standardhealth/shr_spec) repo.  As the SHR text format (and content files) are still evolving, so is this toolset.

# Getting the Code

To run the SHR command-line interface, you need to first download the _shr-cli_ code.  This can be done via _git clone_ or by clicking the green "Clone or download" button and choosing "Download Zip" (which you will then need to unzip to a folder of your choosing).

# Setting Up the Environment

To run the command-line interface, you must perform the following steps to install its dependencies:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS edition, currently 8.x)
2. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (1.3.x or above)
3. Execute the following from this project's root directory: `yarn`

# Exporting SHR to JSON and FHIR

After setting up the environment, you can use node to import a folder of files from CAMEO (SHR text format) and export the definitions to JSON and FHIR:
```
$ node . /path/to/shr_spec/spec
```

The command above will export these formats to the _out_ directory.

It is also possible to override the default logging level or format, skip exports, override the default output folder, or change the configuration file to use:
```
$ node . --help

  Usage: shr-cli <path-to-shr-defs> [options]

  Options:

    -l, --log-level <level>  the console log level <fatal,error,warn,info,debug,trace> (default: info)
    -m, --log-mode <mode>    the console log mode <short,long,json,off> (default: short)
    -s, --skip <feature>     skip an export feature <fhir,json,cimcore,json-schema,es6,model-doc,all> (default: <none>)
    -a, --adl                run the adl exporter (default: false)
    -o, --out <out>          the path to the output folder (default: out)
    -c, --config <config>    the name of the config file (default: config.json)
    -d, --duplicate          show duplicate error messages (default: false)
    -i, --import-cimcore     import CIMCORE files instead of CIMPL (default: false)
    -6, --export-cimpl-6     export CIMPL 6 files generated  from input (default: false)
    -h, --help               output usage information
```

For example:
```
node . ../shr_spec/spec -l error -o out2 -c other_config.json
```

# Advanced Logging

The SHR tools use the [Bunyan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunyan) structured logging framework, and store a full log file in the output folder (note: it will be appended to on subsequent runs).  You can use the Bunyan CLI tool to perform advanced filtering of the log file.  For example:
```
node_modules/.bin/bunyan -c 'this.shrId=="shr.vital.BloodPressure"'  -o short out/out.log
```
(On Windows, replace `/` with `\` in the example).

For more information on Bunyan and Bunyan CLI, see the Bunyan documentation.

# Creating the FHIR Implementation Guide

After exporting the SHR definitions, the FHIR IG Publisher tool can be used to create a FHIR implementation guide, containing HTML documentation, bundled definitions, and more.  This requires that the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8/9 or Java SDK (JSDK) are installed on your system.  It also requires Jekyll ([Mac/Linux](https://jekyllrb.com/) / [Windows](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/1-ruby-and-devkit/)). After ensuring they are installed, run the following command:
```
$ yarn run ig:publish
```

NOTE: The FHIR IG publishing tool uses a _lot_ of memory when processing the full set of SHR definitions.  The yarn script above will allocated up to 8GB of RAM. A minimum of 4GB of RAM is recommended to run the tool.

# Creating the FHIR Implementation Guide Using an HTTP Proxy

If your system requires a proxy to access the internet, you'll need to take a more complex approach than above.

First, export a system environment variable called JAVA_OPTS, setting the proxies as appropriate.

On Mac or Linux:
```
$ export JAVA_OPTS="-Dhttp.proxyHost=my.proxy.org -Dhttp.proxyPort=80 -Dhttps.proxyHost=my.proxy.org -Dhttps.proxyPort=80 -DsocksProxyHost=my.proxy.org -DsocksProxyPort=80"
```

On Windows:
```
> SET JAVA_OPTS=-Dhttp.proxyHost=my.proxy.org -Dhttp.proxyPort=80 -Dhttps.proxyHost=my.proxy.org -Dhttps.proxyPort=80 -DsocksProxyHost=my.proxy.org -DsocksProxyPort=80
```

Next, create the IG using the HL7 IG Publisher Tool.

On Mac or Linux:
```
$ java $JAVA_OPTS -Xms4g -Xmx8g -jar out/fhir/guide/org.hl7.fhir.igpublisher.jar -ig out/fhir/guide/ig.json
```

On Windows:
```
> java %JAVA_OPTS% -Xms4g -Xmx8g -jar out/fhir/guide/org.hl7.fhir.igpublisher.jar -ig out/fhir/guide/ig.json
```

# Configuration File

The SHR tools require a configuration file in the path to the SHR specification definitions. Configuration files *must* be valid JSON, have at least the `projectName` property, and use the `.json` file extension.

If a configuration file name is specified using the `-c` command line option, the SHR tools look for a file with this name in the specification definitions directory. If it cannot be found or it is an invalid configuration file, an error is returned. If no configuration file is specified at startup, the SHR tools look for a file called `config.json` in this directory. If it is not found, a default `config.json` file is auto-generated and used.

The contents of the configuration file are as follows:

|Parameter            |Type    |Description                                                    |

# Primary Selection Strategy and Filter Strategy

When using this command-line interface and IG publisher, the general order of operations is as follows:

1. The command-line interface takes in SHR definitions that have been written (as in the [shr_spec](https://github.com/standardhealth/shr_spec) repo) and parses them through a text importer.
2. The command-line interface exports these parsed SHR definitions files into desired formats, such as ES6, JSON, FHIR, etc.
3. (optional) The IG publisher takes the SHR FHIR exports and generates an IG from the information in these files.

Often times when exporting files and creating implementation guides, between steps 1 and 2 above, it may be necessary to remove extraneous elements written into the SHR definition files, or highlight specific elements as more important in the IG. This is where the primary selection strategy and filter strategy come into play.

The primary selection strategy is used to set certain entries in the IG as primary. This causes those entries to be listed in a "Primary" section at the top of their respective pages in the IG, displaying them as most directly relevant. All other elements are listed in a "Supporting" section below the "Primary" section.

The options for the configuration file's `implementationGuide.primarySelectionStrategy` are described below.

* The `"entry"` `strategy` for primary selection sets every entry as primary in the IG.
* The `"namespace"` `strategy` for primary selection sets every entry found in the namespaces in the `primary` array as primary in the IG.
* The `"hybrid"` `strategy` for primary selection sets every entry listed in the `primary` array or found in the namespaces in the `primary` array as primary in the IG.
* If there is no `strategy` set in the `implementationGuide.primarySelectionStrategy`, the default operation is the `"entry"` `strategy`.

The filter strategy is used to determine which elements from the SHR definitions are processed through the various exporters. If only a subset of the SHR definitions are desired in an export, or a subsequent IG generation, then filtering down to target elements or namespaces causes only those targets (and their dependencies) to be exported, ignoring the rest.

The options for the configuration file's `implementationGuide.filterStrategy` are described below.

* The `"element"` `strategy` for filtering will filter the specifications to only include the elements listed in the `target` array and their recursive dependencies.
* The `"namespace"` `strategy` for filtering will filter the specifications to only include the elements included in the namespaces listed in the `target` array and their recursive dependencies.
* The `"hybrid"` `strategy` for filtering will filter the specifications to only include the elements listed in the `target` array and included in the namespaces listed in the `target` array and their recursive dependencies.
* If `filter` is `true`, then the filtering operation will occur. Otherwise, no filtering will occur.
* If there is no `implementationGuide.filterStrategy` set, filtering will not occur.

When specifying a namespace or element in the `primary` or `target` array of either strategy, it is best
to use the fully qualified name (FQN) format for doing so. For example, a namespace could be
`"shr.oncology"` and an element could be `"shr.oncology.BreastCancerStage"`.
