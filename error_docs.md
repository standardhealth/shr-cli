| ------------  | ------------- | -------- |
| 11013          | Failed to resolve definition for `$ELEMENT_NAME`  | The referenced Element doesn't exist in the current namespace, or in any of its inherited parents. Check spelling errors as well as imports. |

| 02001          | WARN shr: Potentially mismatched targets. Based on class (shr.core.Duration) maps to Duration. |

| 11015          | token recognition error at: `$CHARACTER` | This is usually a typo issue. Investigate keywords and missing colons around the specificed text input.
| 11016          | mismatched input `$INPUT` expecting `$LIST_OF_KEYWORDS` | This is usually a typo issue. Investigate spelling and keywords used around the specificied text input.
| 11023          | extraneous input `$INPUT` expecting `$LIST_OF_KEYWORDS` | This is usually a typo issue. Investigate spelling and keywords used around the specificied text input.
| 12004          | No cardinality found for field: `$FIELD`                           | Explicity define cardinality for that field. |

# All Warning Codes

| Warning Code | Warning Message | Solution |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------- |
| 01001 | No project configuration file found, currently using default EXAMPLE identifiers. Auto-generating a proper 'config.json' in your specifications folder | Open the 'config.json' file and customize it for your project.
| 01002 | Config file missing key: `$KEY`, using default key: `$DEFAULT VALUE` instead.   | Open the 'config.json' file and add your project specific details for that key.
| 02001 | Potentially mismatched targets: `$CLASS` maps to `$ITEM`, but based on class (`$CLASS`) maps to `$ITEM`, and `$ITEM` is not based on `$ELEMENT` in `$CLASS`.' | You're overwriting an inherited mapping. This is not necessarily an issue, but is definitely something to be cautious of. |
| 03001 | Trying to map `$PROFILE` to `$CODE`, but `$PROFILE` was previously mapped to it | 
| 03002 | Choice has equivalent types, so choice options may overwrite or override each other when mapped to FHIR. |
| 03003 | Overriding extensible value set constraint from `$VS` to `$VS`.  Only allowed when new codes do not overlap meaning of old codes. |
| 03004 | Element profiled on Basic. Consider a more specific mapping. | The Basic profile should not be used in most cases. Consider a more specific profile mapping that categorizes the Element being mapped. |
| 03005 | No mapping to '`$ELEMENT PATH`'. This property is core to the target resource and usually should be mapped. |  
| 03006 | The `$PROPERTY` property is not bound to a value set, fixed to a code, or fixed to a quantity unit. This property is core to the target resource and usually should be constrained |
| 04001 | Unsupported code system: '`$CODESYSTEM`' |

# Code Number Explanation

***1*** 2 3 4 5 <br>
&nbsp;↳&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First digit tells whether it is an warning or error. 0 = warning, 1 = error <br>

1 ***2*** 3 4 5 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↳&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second digit gives the location of the issue: 1 = the grammar and importing of the text files, 2 = the expanding of the specifications, 3 = the exporting of FHIR profiles, 4 = the exporting of the JSON profiles, 5 = the exporting of CIMCORE files <br>

1 2 ***3 4 5*** <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↳&nbsp;&nbsp; The last two digits are simply for unique identification. <br>
